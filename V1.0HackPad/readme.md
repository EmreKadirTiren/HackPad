## V1.0 Emre-HackPad
This is my first attempt at making a PCB for my hackpad. I wanted it 100x100 mm but made it to big. While designing this PCB I learned a lot about how KiCad works. This PCB has the following things:
- 17x MX Keyswitches
- 1x RotaryEncoder
- 1x XIA RP2040

I used a Matrix for de Keyswitsches wich was fun to design. I made this while participating in hackclubs: "You Ship, We Ship"

Hackpad is a limited-time You Ship, We Ship (YSWS) where you can learn how to make your own macropad, and then we ship your design to you! Join #hackpad in the slack to stay up to date and see what other people are working on! Ends October 21st 2024.

The requirments for this hackpad is the following: 
- The overall design uses 20 or less inputs/switches. This includes rotary encoders!
- The PCB is under 100mm in either direction, and only uses 2 layers
- Your design is fully original
- The macropad uses a through-hole Seeed XIAO RP2040 as its main MCU. No exceptions
